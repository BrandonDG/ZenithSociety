This project has two migrations directories...
One is right under "ZenithWebSite" directory, that is the right place,
and another is "ZenithWebSite\Data", which is created by Visual Studio when it made this project.
So, you should perform migration commands, such as "dotnet ef migrations add FirstMigration", 
right under "ZenithWebSite".

If "ZenithWebSite\Migrations" directory already has migration files, 
you should first get rid of those files by using this command,

dotnet ef migrations remove.

Then you should carry out 

dotnet ef migrations add FirstMigration. 

After that, perform 

dotnet ef database update.

As result, you could get the sqlserver database having empty tables under your login directory.
For example, my computer's user id is "ischoi", 
so ZenithWebSiteDB, that is our assignment database, is created under C:\Users\ischoi directory.

This database doesn't have any seed data, but once you execute the command, 

"dotnet run",

our seed data is inserted into the database.

While dotnet server is running, you could see our first assignment's home page on the web browser, 

http://localhost:5000
